      According to a UGC funded study  close to 40% students in colleges across India face some kind of ragging and only 8.6% reported the incidents and rest of the students kept Quiet .
 The main reason was not having a stable anonymous platform which provided them with a sense of safety while reporting complaints about their situations without any hesitation. So there is a need of a platform where students can speak freely about all the ragging /harassment issues they are facing or have faced up until now.
